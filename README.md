# Sentiment Analysis for Tweets Using Sentiment140 Dataset and Logistic Regression
This project aims to predict the sentiment of tweets using the Sentiment140 dataset, which contains 1.6 million tweets labeled as either positive or negative. Sentiment Analysis is an important task in natural language processing, as it helps to understand people's opinions and emotions about various topics.

# Preprocessing
Before applying logistic regression to the dataset, we performed several preprocessing steps to prepare the data for analysis. These steps included removing URLs, mentions, and special characters, as well as tokenizing the tweets into individual words. We also removed stop words and applied stemming to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.

# Logistic Regression 
Logistic Regression  is a classification algorithm that is widely used in machine learning for binary classification problems.

The basic idea behind logistic regression is to model the probability of a binary outcome using a logistic function. In the case of Sentiment Analysis, the binary outcome is the sentiment of a tweet (positive or negative).
